# Poker Rules:

## First Betting round:
 #### First Turn:
 - This will start right after the card distribution.
 - The player at the left of the Big-blind player have to play/act based on the two cards they are dealt.
 - They only have an options to Fold/Call/Raise.
 - Because we already had two forced bets before card distribution, no player can check in this Betting Round.
 - After this, there comes the turn of the player who is sitting left of the current player.
 - The first betting round ends when the big-blind complete's their turn.

## Second Betting Round:
 - Before starting the second round tree community cards are dealt on the table face up. Now players have 5 cards to make their hands from.
 - This betting round starts from the first active player to the left of the dealer.
 - Since we don't have any forced bets the player doesn't have to put chips into the pot, and the player can Check.
 - At the end of the round if only one player remains that player wins the Game. If there are more then one player still in the game the forth Community card is dealt face up, and next betting round starts.

## Remaining Betting Rounds:
 - The betting rounds will go on until there is only one player remains on the table, or all 5 of the community cards are dealt and after that all players have taken their action bet/call/check/fold.
 - At the end of the final betting round if there are more then one player is remaining they will do a face-off. Where they both will show their cards and whoever's hand has the highest point wins the game, and takes all the money.

## Next Game:
 - At the start of a new game the dealer button is rotated clock-wise. And active players to the left of the dealer will become Small-Blind and Big-Blind. And the whole game starts again from the first betting round.

## Impotent:  
 - At the any point of time a new player joins the table they have to wait for the current game to be completed and at the beginning of the next game they will be marked at an ANTE.
 - In the first round when there is a turn of any of the blind-bet players(small, big, ante) and if they want to bet/call/raise, the amount they bet blindly will also be accounted for. For example it's small-blind's turn to bet they already bet 50-chips as a small blind, not why want to call 200-chips bet they only have to put 150-chips into the pot. It means **chips to add** = **amount of bet/call** - **amount of blind bet**.

# Glossary:
 - **Dealer**: In a traditional poker game dealer is the person who is dealing the cards to all the players on the table. And the next two players left of a dealer are Small-blind, and Big-blind, respectively. However if you are playing at a Casino or a Tournament, you table will most-likely will have a dedicated dealer for dealing the card. At that point the tag/title or dealer-button as some might call it, is only there to decide which two players are going to be small and big blinds, and from where the card distribution will start.
 - **Small-Blind**: This player is forced to bet blindly, half of minimum bet amount, before dealer start dealing cards to players.
 - **Big-Blind**: This player is forced to bet blindly, minium bet amount, before dealer start dealing cards to players.
 - **ANTE**: Any player marked as ANTE is forced to bet blind along with small-blind and big-blind, the amount of the bet will be of big-blind.
 - **Game**: A Game is a time from Card distribution to Winner declaration.
 - **Betting Round**: A Betting Round is from First Turn to the first player right of the First Turn player.
 - **Fold**: Player is don't want to continue this Game, they are surrendering the pot and will sit out for the rest of the Game until the next Game starts.
 - **Call**: Player want to match the bet made by the previous player(a player who placed a bet).
 - **Bet**: I'm putting chips into the pot. This is generally the first time any player puts chips into the pot. The limit for min-max bet is pre-defined at the start of the game.
 - **Raise**: Player places a bet of higher amount then the previous bet. All the players after have to match this bet amount. Minium Raise is double the big blind, Max is have to set or in case of no-limits player can do all-in at any time.
 - **Check**: In the current betting round if no player has placed any bets, the player who's turn it is they can Check for free(not adding mony in the pot), and the turn goes to the next active player who can also check if they so desire. Player can not check if there is a bet placed by another player earlier in the same Betting Round.
 - **Community Cards**: Cards dealt at the middle of the table face-up, which can be used by all the player to create their best hand of 5 card out of 2 card which they were dealt at the beginning of the game, and all the available Community cards. There can only be 5 community card at max for every game.
